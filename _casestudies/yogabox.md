overview: "**Yogabox provides personalised yoga courses, focused on the therapeutic benefits of better alignment.** Interactive modules, real-time feedback and 1:1 advice ensure yoga students feel more confident. **Meaningful nteractions with students elevates yoga teachers to an advisor role. All the work shown is my own.**"  
challange: "**There is no centralised platform empowering both yoga students and independent yoga teachers.** When following video classes at-home, **yoga students are concerned about misalignment. Yoga teachers are missing personalised connections with students,** and view themselves as more than just fitness instructors."

content="**Yoga students and teachers struggle with at-home yoga. For this reason, both were considered for Yogabox.** At-home yoga and fitness today is driven by video platforms. With this, **students worry about misalignment and injury while practicing at home.** On the other side, **teachers are missing that personal connection with their students.**" %}

content="**Many students and teachers started yoga for its physical benefits,** to then discover its contribution to mental well-being. **They found yoga an effective means of therapy and prevention.** This is especially important for the target age group, as they voiced concern around physical mobility while ageing. Yoga was **viewed as a lifelong practice focused more on improvement than achievement.**" %}

The name takes cues from both bento and subscription boxes, reflecting the **modularity, convenience and personalisation.**" %}

## Design

{% include case_h3_block.html 
title="Structure + Flow" 
content="**Students were the focus for conceptual app development.** Getting started with the app, and continuing to use it while improving yoga alignment was important to understand. Five flows (four student and one teacher) were explored, in addition to a site map specific to students. **The most important aspects included clarity of flow and information to ensure the concept was immediate.**" %}

## Validate

{% include case_h3_block.html 
title="Overview" 
content="**Throughout the interviews, personalisation was a key theme.** However, this can be executed and understood in many ways. Through usability testing, it became clear the **balance between personalisation and convenience, choice and simplicity, access and earnings.** This was done through four rounds of usability tests, each with five users." %}

{% capture info-highlight %}
#### 1. Product’s Value
Yogabox provided a therapeutic and instructional benefit that at-home yoga programs did not provide.
|
#### 2. Incentivising Users
Putting the program behind a registration wall disincentivized users.
|
#### 3. Understandable Modules
Many did not understand they could build their own program from different modules.
|
#### 4. Video Assessment
A video assessment seemed personalised, yet inconvenient.
|
#### 5. Revisting Modules
The existing UI made it look like the finished course modules could not be revisited.
|
#### 6. Switch Users
A toggle was provided to switch to a teacher during sign up. This was overlooked.

## The Result

{% include case_h3_block.html 
title="Overview" 
content="**Yogabox brings together the convenience of practicing at home with the benefits of 1:1 instruction.** Students are able to trial their personalised yoga classes, while understanding the value of the platform in the long-term. Personalisation comes through **curated course modules plus purposeful 1:1 appointments.**" %}

## The Debrief

{% include case_h3_block.html 
title="Next Steps" 
content="**It’s clear the app is about both the experience and program structure.** By building out one hypothetical course, we could measure its engagement and effectiveness. **This pilot phase would help to test the overall concept and whether both users find it worthwhile to use overtime.** The lessons learned below can be integrated into next steps for the Yogabox." %}

{% capture info-highlight %}
#### Refine Two Users
Two user groups bring added insight and value, but also complexity. I need to focus more on the teachers for the next phase.
|
#### Improve Accessibility
There are many aspects to accessibility. This requires further development to enable all users looking for theraputic benefits.
|
#### Explore User Flows
It’s necessary to understand its role within the greater context. This means always building the user flows before jumping into a design.
