challange: "**Artvoy sells paintings over 5k on their mobile-web experience.** They find it **difficult to acquire and convert new, younger users. Younger users are abandoning the website without moving any items to their cart.** Additionally, 70% of younger users who place items in their cart do not purchase a piece. "  
approach: "**Created the concept single-handed over a series of weeks.** As the artworld is changing, I wanted to take into consideration both the user and expert perspective. **By focusing on the research and concept phase, a platform emerged** that attracted and converted younger users by offering flexibility and tailored options."
responsibilities: [Brand Strategy, Experience Strategy, Customer Experience, UX Research, UX Testing, UX Design, UI Design]

## Analyse

{% include case_h3_block.html 
title="Meet Users and Experts" 
content="Both art collectors and gallery owners agreed that **art purchases of that scale are still emotionally-driven and seen as a way to enhance life.** Art purchases of this type are not regarded as investments. Users **buy on aesthetics and want to make a spontaneous purchase. Trust, credibility and communicating value are key** to convert users on a new platform." %}

#### Users emphasised:
Art is a means to express yourself and tell your story. Many viewed art as meaningful home decor, even taking pieces home to try in their home before purchasing.
|
#### Experts emphasised:
Findability is a challenge for gallery owners and paintings lose their magic online. Selling a painting takes time, where some clients prefer to see a piece in-person.

content="**New to Art and Art Collectors are the two personas** of young art collectors. **New to Art users feel hesitant about their ability to select artwork**, and are open to learning more about art and art collecting. **Existing Art Collectors are looking to find pieces to complement or even challenge their existing collection**, while discovering new artists." %}

## Apply

{% include case_h3_block.html 
title="Structure and Flow" 
content="**In order to improve conversion, two red routes were considered. Conversion happens overtime**, where users mentioned the value and desire to see paintings in-person. **The site map looked to overcome catalogue-heavy art platforms** by integrating inspiration, advice and the ability to learn more about art to encourage enjoyable exploration." %}

## Assess

{% include case_h3_block.html 
title="Overview" 
content="Conducted two user tests, one for wireframes and the other for the high-fidelity prototype. Looked to uncover usability issues within the red routes. **Ensuring the product search was clear, appointment booking was appropriate to the overall customer journey and monthly payment process provided the needed information were key focuses.** Tested on five users per round of testing." %}

{% capture info-highlight %}
#### 1. Obviously Art 
Though the inspirational sections were helpful, users wanted to see art on the homepage.
|
#### 2. Clear Search Diagram
More clarity was desired on the diagram’s meaning or how it related to result categories.
|
#### 3. Encourage Exploration
Ensure users are able to continue exploring when finished with certain tasks or searches.
|
#### 4. Importance of Dimensions
Users wanted to see dimensions earlier on, as it is an important consideration for art purchases.
|
#### 5. Repeat Bookings
If users were booking multiple viewings, the existing flow took too much time.
|
#### 6. Clear Monthly Payment
Improve information available on monthly payments to avoid confusion during the process.

## The Result

{% include case_h3_block.html 
title="Overview" 
content="Younger art collectors are provided **curated options to narrow their search, enabling them to find the painting that will enhance their life.** There is a degree of flexibility during consideration and purchase. Services like monthly payment plans and renting **provides a lower barrier to acquiring art**, while appointment bookings speak to the desire to see paintings in-person. " %}

## The Debrief

{% include case_h3_block.html 
title="Next Steps <br>and Learnings" 
content="**Artvoy features patterns that deviate from normal ecomm experiences due to the nature of an art purchase at that price.** For this reason, these would require further testing. This could be done through **A/B and tree testing**. Once launching the site, it would be **beneficial to understand how users are reacting to the three call-to-actions and booking on the product page.**" %}

{% capture info-highlight %}
#### High-Ticket is Still Emotional
Purchasing a painting by emerging artists even above 5k is still emotional. This influences how paintings are shown and what information is valued. 
|
#### Conversions can Include Offline
Many users still valued seeing a painting in-person. This means the time to convert is longer, and should be accommodated within a digital platform. 
|
#### Social Media’s Influence 
Instagram made it easier to view curations, interior design ideas and artistic process. This level of accessible is valued within higher price purchases as well.
