challange: "Bringly specialises in sustainable, last-mile delivery throughout Europe. In order to look more professional and credible, Bringly recently updated their brand identity. This is reflected in their website, but not in their B2B portal. There are also parts of their new design system that could be expanded on or improved."
approach: "In order to work within a certain scope, it was necessary to focus on the key red route for B2B customers. This was the create new deliveries feature, as it was frequently used B2B  interaction. Through a design system audit, competitor research and UX/UI best practices, this and the additional screens were improved."
