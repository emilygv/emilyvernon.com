challange: "**Bringly specialises in sustainable, last-mile delivery throughout Europe.** In order to look more professional and credible, **Bringly recently updated their brand identity. This is reflected in their website, but not in their B2B portal.** There are also parts of their new design system that could be expanded on or improved."
approach: "In order to work within a certain scope, **it was necessary to focus on the key red route for B2B customers. This was the create new deliveries feature, as it was frequently used B2B  interaction.** Through a design system audit, competitor research and UX/UI best practices, this and the additional screens were improved."
responsibilities: [Design Systems Audit, Competitor Research, Project Management, UX Design, UI Design]
