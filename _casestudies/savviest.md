challange: "**Savviest is an ai-enhanced job seeking preparation platform.** They offer a resume and cover letter builder and optimiser, in addition to job search and professional coaching. **To better serve their users, Savviest is interested in creating a interview preparation tool to create a more holistic ecosystem.**"  
approach: "**Collaborated with another UX/UI designer**, while checking-in twice a week with the Savviest team. **The two of us worked on all aspects of the process, but chose a lead per task.** This allowed us to divide the work, while still making responsibilities clear. Savviest had a solid base to build from for this feature."
responsibilities: [Workshop Moderation, Stakeholder Management, Experience Strategy, Customer Experience, UX Research, UX Testing, UX Design, UI Design]

title="Meet Users and Experts" 
content="**There are two sides to interviewing: the interviewee and interviewer. For this reason, we spoke to both users and experts.** Our users were individuals currently or recently going through job interviews, while experts included hiring managers, career coaches and recruiters. **We were able to analyse how users prepped versus what hiring managers looked for in a candidate.**" %}

content="Conducted five of ten interviews across users and experts for a total of 4 hours of video. The stickers are votes from the team in terms of important or interesting points." %}

#### Users emphasised:
Building confidence for interviews by creating a toolbox of questions and answers. Their best interviews felt like conversations.
|
#### Experts emphasised:
The importance of doing your homework, as it can make an interview feel more like a conversation.

title="Sharpen User Understanding" 
content="Savviest had a general understanding of its demographics, however **we needed to better understand the types of users who would benefit from this platform.** For this reason, we chose archetypes over personas. This helped us **focus on key user needs. We used insights from the user and expert interviews to form our archetypes.**" %}

title="Competitor Landscape" 
content="**There are a range of interview preparation platforms available.** Some are specialised and others within a greater job search readiness platform. After evaluating these two areas, we learned **platforms focused on questions or coaching. The idea of creating conversations and shaping your stories was not addressed.**" %}

## Define

{% include case_h3_block.html 
title="Product Strategy" 
content="**We created a Lean Concept Canvas after the workshops with stakeholders to review the results.** This helped to focus our efforts for the MVP. Our stakeholders were keen to roll out features overtime, and launch with the most impactful solution. **Savviest’s content focus, yet personal approach is a unique space to develop within interview preparation.**" %}

#### Unique Value Proposition
Flexible, holistic stories transforming job interviews into enjoyable conversations.
|

## Design

{% include case_h3_block.html 
title="Structure + Flow" 
content="As the interview feature was included as a part of an existing platform, **we needed to understand how it would fit in and reflect the existing UI patterns.** This was done through sketching and analysing the current user experience. It was necessary to **access the interview preparation features through both the job tracker and the main navigation**, much like the resume or cover letter builders." %}

## Validate

{% include case_h3_block.html 
title="Overview" 
content="**The two red routes were tested with five recent or current job seekers who reflected our archetypes.** This included users who are moving up or pivoting from other careers. **These were split between our team of two, and insight consolidated in a Google doc and affinity map.** The latter was a more interactive way to share with the greater team." %}

#### 1. Notes is Considered Interview  Preparation as Well
The call-to-action, ‘Prep for Interview’ was not clear as users also considered note taking part of the prep process.
|
#### 2. Relevant Storybuilding Prompts
Walking through prompts for building out interview answers was exciting for users, but did not seem to match with the proposed STAR structure.
|
#### 3. Expects Personalised Question Sets
Seeing question sets not recommended to them firstly was confusing, and users expected and valued personalisation.
|
#### 4. Likes Writing Own Questions
Users liked writing their own questions, as they knew which ones would be asked or had ones specifically on their mind.
|
#### 5. Writing Answers and Practicing is Not Always Sequential
Users wanted to practice individual questions, or jump into a round of running through questions before writing answers.
|
#### 6. Clarify Practice Options 
Users were unsure of the difference between practice and record, as well as what practice entailed.

## The Result

{% include case_h3_block.html 
title="Overview" 
content="By focusing on the red routes, **we were able to create a focused concept around building and practicing your stories.** This emphasis on modular content reflected the Savviest platform, and **enabled users to have better conversations during job interviews.** The key deliverable was wireframes, however we also did five high fidelty screens to demonstrate the final execution." %}

## The Debrief

{% include case_h3_block.html 
title="Next Steps <br>& Key Learnings" 
content="It was necessary to think about both the ideal and ability of the start-up. For the time allocated, we were able to do one round of testing, however **this would require another round of user testing. We were able to explore improving the job profile and making it more mobile-friendly, but this should be further development.** A product roadmap would help with all points mentioned." %}

#### High-Ticket is Still Emotional
Purchasing a painting by emerging artists even above 5k is still emotional. This influences how paintings are shown and what information is valued. 
|
#### Conversions can Include Offline
Many users still valued seeing a painting in-person. This means the time to convert is longer, and should be accommodated within a digital platform. 
|
#### Social Media’s Influence 
Instagram made it easier to view curations, interior design ideas and artistic process. This level of accessible is valued within higher price purchases as well.
