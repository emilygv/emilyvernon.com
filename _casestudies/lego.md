challange: "Every Lego store looks to top the previous store in terms of storytelling, experience and design. **Our team was tasked to help run design workshops to ensure the store reflected the locality in a fun, genuine way.** This is because visitors to the Kalverstraat location were both local and tourist."  
approach: "Most Lego stores are a series of separate touchpoints. **We wanted to create a cohesive story throughout the store.** This meant we did research as a design and strategy team around the different themes, **sketched with the Lego team and then looked at how to unify the imaginative experiences.**"
responsibilities: [Workshop Moderation, Design Sprint Design, Stakeholder Management, Experience Strategy, Touchpoint Ideation, Brand Storytelling]
