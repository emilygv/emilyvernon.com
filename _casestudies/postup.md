challange: "**Freelancers and remote workers want to find great coffee shops, free spaces and public spaces to work from.** There is a possibility that the chosen location will not have what they need, or the staff are lukewarm to remote workers. **Currently, they are frustrated by the time spent looking for places to work.**"  
approach: "**Established an app MVP by completing a solo Google Sprint over a week.** My goal was to try all aspects of the methodology, and identify the most value-add user flow. **The use of sketching throughout the process was an effective way to explore** how to provide information specific to remote working in out-of-home spaces. "
responsibilities: [Design Sprint Moderation, Brand Strategy, Experience Strategy, Customer Experience, UX Research, UX Testing, UX Design, UI Design]

## Analyse

{% include case_h3_block.html 
title="Meet our Users" 
content="**Day 1, Design Sprint. Users are looking for spaces that are quiet, uncrowded, can accommodate phone calls and are appropriate for quick meetings.** They desire locations that have quick (ideally free) wifi, outlets and bathrooms. These **amenities trump good coffee and food. Finding places in new areas for an hour or two between meetings**, or ones that are worker-friendly, is important." %}

{% include img_caption.html 
title="End-to-end experience sketch" 
content="In order to understand the app’s functionality within the users’ greater context, an end-to-end experience sketch was created." %}

{% include blockquote.html 
content="If a place has Wifi, outlets and bathrooms - that’s all I need. Bonus points if their coffee and food are actually good!" 
reference="Claire, Freelancer" %}

{% include case_h3_block.html 
title="Analogous Experiences" 
content="**Day 2, Design Sprint: PostUp can learn from experiences within different industries.** This includes working remotely, utilising space for alternative purposes or reading through friendly, specific profiles. For this reason, apps or websites addressing such topics were explored for inspiration. **During user interviews, these were also mentioned as analogous experiences, especially Airbnb.**" %}

## Articulate

{% include case_h3_block.html 
title="Critical Screens" 
content="**Day 2, Design Sprint: The most critical screen is reviewing a potential location.** This is because if it’s already filtered by a certain distance radius, users can make decisions promptly on the information provided. **Getting to the critical screen with the location’s information should be quick.**" %}

{% include blockquote.html 
content="Information out there is time-consuming to dig through, with a lot of jumping back-and-forth between sites." 
reference="Chelsea, Freelance Graphic Designer" %}

## Apply

{% include case_h3_block.html 
title="Interactions" 
content="**Day 3, Design Sprint**: Instead of creating user flows, **key microinteractions were considered through a storyboard format.** This allowed for quick ideation, while thinking through critical moments. What became apparent was the **importance of clear, illustrative information through graphs, icons or maps/plans.**" %}

{% include case_h3_block.html 
title="Design System" 
content="**Day 4, Design Sprint:  Expanded the existing brand colour and graphics to create a friendly, straightforward and ‘fresh start’ visual language.** The palette is energising and calming, helping users when they make prompt decisions. **Iconography plays an important role in making information immediate**, especially amenities and services. " %}

## Assess

{% include case_h3_block.html 
title="Overview" 
content="**Day 5, Design Sprint: Five users tested the app, where four out of the five worked from cafes, while one did not.** The latter provided insightful context into why, and how this app might encourage her to reconsider. **Minimising distraction and creating a boundary between work and home were influential factors in deciding on and selecting a place to work out-of-home.** " %}

{% capture info-highlight %}
#### 1. Dual Prompt
The prompt ‘I’m Interested’ for PostUps near you was chosen half of the time, where ‘Search’ was the other option.
|
#### 2. Next Navigation
Next arrow cause confusion, and a number of users though it was to get directions.
|
#### 3. Icon Clarity
Main navigation icons were not immediately recognised by users, especially the web icon.
|
#### 4. Parking Information
Users wanted information about parking, including what type, possible duration and whether it was paid.
|
#### 5. Seating Amenities
Provide more context around seating amenities, including outlet placement.
|
#### 6. Seating Availability
Seating availability feature was valued but partially unclear, as users did not understand 'unknown'.

## The Result

{% include case_h3_block.html 
title="Overview" 
content="Through the Google Ventures sprint process, an MVP was created for finding remote work locations. **The intuitive experience and information structure enables users to find a location quickly, even between meetings. A fresh, uplifting and clean look & feel makes the app and its options feel friendly.** This is important as remote workers want to feel welcome." %}

## The Debrief

{% include case_h3_block.html 
title="Next Steps <br>and Learnings" 
content="With only one key flow addressed, the **next steps include building out the next flows for another round of testing.** It would also need to go through a round of stakeholder approvals considering the quick process. **As this app would be used on-the-go, it would help to understand if it is easy-to-use in context.**" %}

#### Faster Process, Solid Results 
A design sprint is a short development time. However, the outcome still tested well compared to more involved design projects.
|
#### Small Details Comes off as Caring
Travelling to another location includes dealing with weather. Providing weather advice came off as caring to users.
|
#### Design Reflects Relevance 
Like any design discipline, there are trends that date a user interface. Ensure current trends or best practices are used.
