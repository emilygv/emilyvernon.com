challange: "Clinique wants to create great skin for everyone. While the brand is well-known in the US, **brand awareness in China is low. The teamâ€™s ambition was to relaunch the brand in China with a flagship location.** It should interpret the brand and experience for the Chinese consumer."  
approach: "Worked with a team of designers and a creative director to bring this to life. Defining and clarifying the **user needs, cultural expectations, competitor landscape, design sensibility and USPs of the brand was key** to build out the retail concept, touchpoints and services."
responsibilities: [Workshop Design, Workshop Moderation, Competitor Analysis, Brand Strategy, Experience Strategy, Customer Personas, Customer Journey Mapping, Touchpoint Guidelines, Communication Hierarchy, Service Design]
