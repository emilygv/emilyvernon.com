      My approach combines being brave and creative. This means challenging my perception by continuously learning. I do all sorts of things - like reading, learning UX, ink painting or sailing worldwide. I am powered by peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

    text: |-
      I workED as a Senior Creative Strategist for UXUS (a FutureBrand company), transforming brands by increasing consumer engagement and brand perception within retail and hospitality spaces, IRL. 
      
      Over the last three years, my specialties included hotel design strategy and guest experience. 

      Before becoming a strategist, I designed footwear for Converse from both the global and EMEA offices. My role evolved into leading regional consumer trend and insights across EMEA, Brazil and APAC, while contributing insights to Nike as well.
