      Before becoming a strategist, I designed footwear for Converse from both the global and EMEA offices. My role evolved into leading regional consumer trend and insights across EMEA, Brazil and APAC, while contributing insights to Nike as well. 

      In my free time you can find me doing all sorts of side projects - like learning UI/UX or illustration. I am happy to chat about articles, insights or creative process.
