      My approach combines being brave and creative. This means challenging my perception by continuously learning. I do all sorts of things - like writing comedy, learning UX/UI, ink painting or sailing. I am powered by peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

      Throughout my career Iâ€™ve enabled brands to better engage their audiences through experience. These interactions ranged from products to service rituals, physical environments to digital platforms. 

      This interest in brand experience started at Converse/Nike, where my footwear design role evolved into leading Customer Insights across multiple regions. I then develop my strategy and experience design expertise at UXUS (a FutureBrand Company), focusing on retail, hospitality and brand spaces.

      I believe my work as a CX (customer experience) designer, brand strategist and user experience designer (UXD) can truly impact the human experience.
