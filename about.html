            <p>Let’s start with the basics. Dutch croquettes don’t satisfy my cravings for the fish tacos of my Los Angeles childhood, and I really wish I could speak multiple languages. As a proud resident of Amsterdam West, I tell people it’s the best hangout whenever possible. My music preferences depend on where I live and so does my taste in food, so right now I am totally into layered electronics and appeltaart – and sometimes together. I’ll try, do or eat anything once as long as it does not interfere with my traveling, sailing or recharging schedule.</p>
