            <p>Let’s start with the basics. Dutch croquettes don’t satisfy my cravings for the fish tacos of my Los Angeles childhood, personality tests show my nationality to be Danish over American and I really wish I could speak multiple languages. As a proud resident of Amsterdam Noord, I tell people it’s the next Shoreditch, Brooklyn or Kreuzberg whenever possible. My music preferences depend on where I live and so does my taste in food, so right now I am totally into layered electronic sounds and appeltaart – and sometimes together. I’ll try, do or eat anything once as long as it does not interfere with my traveling, sailing or recharging schedule.</p>
