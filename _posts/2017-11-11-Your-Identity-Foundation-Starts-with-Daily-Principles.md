**Each of us makes a statement in the way we live day-to-day. Many times these are absent from our Instagram posts or Facebook pages, as they are more subtle and profound. However, there’s a bravery in practicing our values consistently - even if they seem illusive - while evaluating their validity, and even researching possibilities of improvement. This is the base of our Identity Foundation.**

Life’s dynamic nature makes everyone’s development both rich and fulfilling, as well as muddy and downright confusing. It's almost like every year presents a new version of ourselves. An upgrade - we hope - influenced by learnings, rewards and failures. To make sense of it all, I sat myself down to write my 'truths', or daily principles. There were many, and the following are the thirty I found most significant.

1. Take action over talk
2. Get the job done without a fuss
3. Build confidence over time, not overnight
4. Streamline morning routines
5. Minimise possessions, and worries
6. Overlook trends or fads
7. Save to invest, invest, invest
8. Control spending habits
9. Negotiate … why not?
10. See ‘no’ as a starting point
11. Take opportunities without hesitation
12. Ask the hard questions
13. Regard asking for help as a sign of strength 
14. Leave situations where not valued
15. Listen fully to advice and let it sink in
16. Let people ‘save face’
17. Lead with compassion
18. Celebrate others’ victories
19. Compete with ourselves, not others
20. Acknowledge and appreciate compliments 
21. Speak up when wronged
22. Refrain from gossiping 
23. P-a-u-s-e 
24. Use both logic and intuition
25. Learned to control emotions
26. Be comfortable being and travelling alone
27. Try fixing or making things 
28. Take care of both mental and physical well-being
29. Seek out challenging, even uncomfortable, situations
30. Test limits to extent comfort zones

We all have our hard days, and not so graceful days. But by reminding ourselves of our daily principles, we can ground our identities when they’ve swayed. And they will. This is why my list is here to stay in Internet-land so I can review them when required. Whether you’ve been looking to change your daily principles, or validate ones you once through odd, I hope these can be of  use. Do this exercise my strong, determined self-willed reader and see where it takes you.
