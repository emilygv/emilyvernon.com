**For the first eight years of my career I worked brand-side in a large company. This experience was full of long-term projects, one-brand focus and an abundance of resources. After getting used to this life, I transitioned to a smaller agency. This was the time my peers were becoming directors, while I went back to an associate-level position. Was it worth it?**

**What we'll cover:**

Our careers will evolve as brand/company/audience needs evolve. This means the position you have in ten years might not be invented or commonplace today. For example, the idea of end-to-end experience, or even UX by that matter, was not as recognised when I was in art school. **We need to re-evaluate our career path every 2-3 years to shift and re-educate where appropriate. These were the exact reasons why I went to an agency mid-career.**

## Learn a lot, and fast

When going agency-side, my goal was to transition into a new role - strategy. This was leagues away from being a footwear designer. There is a lot to learn about strategy, from research to presentation and even the executional aspect. **By going into an agency, I was able to try and perfect different strategy approaches, while applying them across various industries.** Over the course of four years, I was able to gain experience in beauty, luxury, hospitality, sportswear, food & beverage and wellness, to name a few. 

**This type of variety is difficult to acquire brand-side, as your role usually includes becoming well-versed in one specific area of one specific brand/business.** Going agency-side for a career transition was like getting a graduate degree. I felt like I was constantly learning and engaging with various case studies. The different perspectives and solutions were ones I could apply to any industry, as cross-pollination of ideas is key to creating new, yet familiar ideas. 

## Understand what grabs attention

In an agency, you are constantly pitching ideas and work, including internally, for a tender/pitch or within a project. **Whether you are a creative or project manager, you start to understand what types of concepts and presentations catch attention, and which ones don’t.** It’s a constant cycle of trial and error, iteration and refinement.

For example, the concept overview is the ‘big idea’, which can be everything from a marketing campaign to a retail platform. It is a catchy statement or title that encompasses the unique position your project will have. It should be easy, understandable, wow and ultimately shareable. **Creating a ‘big idea’ is one of the most difficult aspects of a project.** It might take days, numerous conversations and hundreds of options to find that wow, yet understandable concept. 

I cannot tell you what a great exercise this is to do time and time again with different clients. It shapes your mind to see the focused, thought-provoking idea that can lead your team and your client to a new, interesting space. **It is so ingrained in my mind that even as I am doing a UX/UI project, this concept of the ‘big idea’ is challenging me to better find and focus my work.** 

## Prep for freelancing, if that’s your goal

For some, transitioning into freelancing is no problem. For others like myself, it can seem like a huge leap. Freelance is a goal of mine, but I am not one of the brave ones who can just jump into the unknown. **When working at a smaller agency, you are able to see how to go through the steps of acquiring, working with and keeping clients.** This includes pitching, clarifying scope and managing expectations as a project progresses. 

Of course these types of learnings can be picked up from a YouTube video or blog post. **However, the most helpful part about seeing this at an agency was understanding what was normal and what was not.** This gave me more confidence to know when to pushback, and when to analyze what went wrong in our process. Though I was not a project or client manager myself, I asked questions about managing clients so I could both improve my work and do the same one day.

## Building relationships overtime

There was one specific project that helped me understand the agency landscape. This was reworking our agency’s portfolio and case studies, where I did extensive research on our competitors as a start. **What quickly became clear was that there were dozens of talented agencies with very similar specs.** Many had similar taglines or missions of ‘transforming’ brands and their customers. So if positioning wasn’t a differentiator, then what was?

**Relationships are key within business - and life. They are especially important in small agencies.** The agency’s personality, including its design, communication, business and relationship style determined a successful collaboration. As a small agency, you become a team within your client’s company. Anyone can get the work done, I mean it’s not rocket science. The key is enjoying the process, and acquiring something valuable beyond deliverables. Perhaps a client learns something new, gets promoted or increases their confidence by working with your agency. That is not a PDF deliverable - that’s a result from a good relationship and personalities that go well together. 

I get it, your colleagues are becoming heavy-weights and you made a mid-career change. A change that is also intense and does not have the comforts of working within a brand. **My four years at an agency were formative in how I looked at working with clients and building creative concepts.** If there is something you want to learn, and an agency provides that - then jump right in.

## Let’s summarise

- This move mid-career can be difficult as others are working their way up into director positions
- Going to an agency is a great way to learn a lot and fast, especially if you are transitioning roles
- As you are constantly pitching ideas, you start to understand what catches others' attention
- If freelancing is your goal, a small agency is a great way to see how it all works
- Agencies say the same things, but relationships are the key differentiator
