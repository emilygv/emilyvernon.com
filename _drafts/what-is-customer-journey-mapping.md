**The infamous customer journey map. You know you need it, you've probably googled it but then - now what? As a CX consultant, I do these maps all the time, but realise it can be intimating. This is because creating a customer journey map is more than an afternoon of work and a singular map. Creating a customer journey map is medium to long-term a project in itself as it's the foundational step to agreeing upon, improving and tracking a customer journey within a particular function or organisation.**

## Why use customer journey mapping

Customer journey maps are visual, and humans are visual creatures. The key word being 'map'. When you plan a short or long journey, it's common to use a map. With a map you can get an overview, while identifying key obstacles or opportunities along the way. This is the same with a customer journey map.

Much like a roadtrip, customer journeys include waypoints, or as we call them branded touchpoints. 
Customer journey maps are a good tool to document, communicate and analyse how customers move between branded touchpoints, whether online and offline. Unlike a roadtrip, however, is that a customer journey can spans more than the 3D world.

Customer journey maps create a relevant, holistic and natural transition between different brand touchpoints. These brand touchpoints can be online and offline. When creating an initial customer experience, teams within organisations often work separately. By establishing a customer journey map, a team or organisation can understand the bigger picture and start to solve key painpoints. By doing the latter, you can better lead a customer to a desired purchase or interaction.

## When to use customer journey mapping

Well, I might be biased, but a brand or business should always have a customer journey map. But don't fear if you don't have one. Brand and businesses have priorities, and perhaps this is just surfacing. Those earlier priorities are also important, such as a business strategy, as it's needed to evaluate and develop a customer journey map.

Key times to create a customer journey map can be when you are evaluating a customer experience or starting a new project. This is because a customer journey map is a tool to create alignment.

## How to create a customer journey map

Sure, you can make a map on your own, or play around with the concept. However, this is better done with a core team and key stakeholders. This is because you want to socialise your project in order to get key stakeholders and teams onboard. Different people also have different perspectives. Having multiple people ensures key painpoints or opportunities are not overlooked.

There are different customer journey maps depending on the team or stakeholder. Your working customer journey map with multiple teams will be detailed. A presentation-ready customer journey map for the C-suite will be edited in order to highlight a key points. Furthermore, sub-customer journey maps can be used for separate purchase formats or phases within the customer journey. 

You might start your map and think - but wait, who is my customer? It might become evident that you actually have multiple customers. Before starting your customer journey map, it is necessary to identify your customer(s). These will be the people to do your customer journey. It is important to have a customer in your mind as you can better identify and empathise with that semi-fictional person. Perhaps you know someone like them, or you've felt like that person before. 

## But a customer journey is not linear

This is correct. Customers bounce around like a pinball to different touchpoints, both online or offline. Think about your own customer journey with a backpack brand, as an example. You might research it online, look at their website, watch an influencer video comparing backpacks, look at it online again, go to their store, compare a price with a third-party supplier - it's not illogical, but sporadic. 

Mapping all of these back-and-forth interactions can get tedious. The extra effort and complexity would not help aligning a team or sifting through the noise. In order to create change within a team or organisation, focus is necessary.

In a way, you are creating a customer journey script, much like you would create a script for a movie. Movies also edit particular things out in order to create a cohesive store for a particular audience. You are doing the same, except you're not James Cameron or Sophia Coppola. Or maybe you are, then welcome to my humble site. 

It's like a treasure hunt, you are leaving different cues along the way for your customer to find. All of these clues should

## Customer journey mapping and design thinking

Design thinking is oh-so popular and over-hyped. But let's clarify where design thinking comes into a customer journey. Design thinking is using a customer-centric approach to a problem. This problem can be internal or external - product, service or process. Basically, go wild with how you want to use design thinking, as it's merely an approach. This is called design thinking as designers typically use this thinking to create solutions. Now it's a catchy phrase, which is why it is more popular. 

Customer journey mapping is a tool within design thinking. It's that simple.
