**A lot has happened since growing up in LA and graduating from the Rhode Island School of Design.**

For over ten years I’ve worked in numerous creative industries, countries and expertises. Whether retail or streetwear, the US or the Netherlands, footwear designer or creative strategist, agency or in-house, each expanded my perspective on design.

To better adapt to today’s rapid developments, I challenge my abilities professionally and personally. My extracurricular activities include everything from stand-up comedy to heavy weather sailing. My ultimate, ultimate dream is to own multiple hotels in hard-to-reach destinations after circumnavigating the world by sailboat.

It’s a tall order, I know. But I have to make up for my short stature somehow.
