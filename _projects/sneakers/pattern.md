Sometimes all you need is a simple pattern to tell a story. Footwear collections can be enhanced by a lining, sockliner or even all over print. The included images showcase a mini floral, animal footprint, oversized floral camo, native flag, flying birds with roses and a print specifically created to commemorate the collaboration between Converse and iconic 100 Club in London.
