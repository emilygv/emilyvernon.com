After working behind a desk most days and seeing footwear only in cad or sample form, an excitement instantly surfaces when I actually see one of my new uppers or footwear collections on the street. Whatever camera I have makes do to document how the shoes are bring worn. Photos are from Paris, Venice and Amsterdam.
