Converseâ€™s history in sports should be celebrated. In classic athletic colorways with open mesh, hairy suede, vintage tooling and duraplush lining, the footwear collection of Auckland Racers at size? stands out on the shelves. Good for runners or just running enthusiasts to brighten up your stride in summer.
